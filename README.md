## Project Overview


This pupose of this project was to create a website that intakes a users input and searches accordingly to display information on UFO sightings. These sightings are based on certain locations which gives a wide range of filters to search by. Down below are the images that show the different search criteria's.

### Summary

 Within the table all filters can be used simutanously in order to pull specific results. The only drawback is that one would have to search through the list of sightings inorder to know what to look for. I would have liked to been able to add a drop down menu that would have given all the variables that a person could search for within the table, so that searching wouldnt become tetious.
